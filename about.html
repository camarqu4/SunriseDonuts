        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Sunrise Donuts was born out of a love for simple, delicious, and handcrafted donuts. Our journey began in 2010, when Sally Sunrise, a passionate baker, decided to turn their dream into reality. What started as a small, family-run bakery has now blossomed into a beloved local establishment.</p>

Our commitment to quality and freshness has earned us a loyal following. We cherish the memories we've created and the community we've built, and we look forward to many more years of serving delightful treats.</p>
